# Quantum Circle Plots

This repository contains documents and code to demonstrate
the circle notation for quantum computing. This notation was
introduced by Eric R. Johnson, Nic Harrigan, and Mercedes
Gimeno-Segovia in their book, *Programming Quantum Computers*.

The file `index.html` contains an explanation of this notation
and it includes graphics and interactive visualizations, or
"widgets".

There is a separate HTML file for each widget. These widgets
can be embedded as iframes in any HTML document, or in a
Jupyter notebook. See the included Jupyter notebook for an
example of this.

Installation is simple. Just copy the files to your web server.
Your website must have HTTPS enabled if you wish to embed the
components in a Jupyter notebook.
